Taveo is an analytic focused click tracking and URL shortening platform. This plugin integrates Taveo with WordPress, allowing 1 click URL shortening.

== Description ==
[Taveo](http://taveo.net/) is an analytics focused URL shortening service. We enable site owners to track and analyze their incoming traffic by monitoring their incoming links. Taveo functions similar to other URL shortening services, but with enhanced functionality. We offer many features that other services do not, such as the ability to use your own domain name for short URLs and detailed statistics about incoming traffic sources.

This plugin integrates Taveo within your Wordpress admin pages. It adds a new menu where you can view all of your Taveo Links in a table. While editing Pages and Posts you will see a  "Track With Taveo" button and it also displays existing Links for that post.

P.S. In order to use this plugin, you must have a [Taveo account](https://admin.taveo.net/register). Registration is Free. 


== Installation ==
